This are the type of branches we can see at any moment in the repository:

* `master` - issues and milestones branches will be merge here.
* `last-stable-release` - matches the last stable tag created. Useful for automation tools.
* `issue-4_fix-email-validation` (issue-number_title) - each issue will have is own branch for development.
* `milestone-12_add-cache` (milestone-number_title) - all Milestone issues will start, track and merged here.

Only `master` and `last-stable-release` branches will be permanent ones in the repository and all other ones will be
removed once they are merged.
